# Lima

The development goal of this program is to create a program that can be used in terminal or GUI to encrypt and decrypt text with weak and modern encryption as well as encrypt files with modern encryptions. See below to find out what has been added and what is scheduled to be added in the future.

Current Version: 0.3.02

Below is a quick overview of what has been done and what still needs to be done.

The following ciphers have been added:

    Caesar Cipher
    ADFGVX Cipher
    ADFGX Cipher

The following ciphers have yet to be added but in progress:

    ADFGX Cipher
    Affine Cipher
    Atbash Cipher
    Autokey Cipher
    Baconian Cipher
    Base64 Cipher
    Beaufort Cipher
    Bifid Cipher
    Codes and Nomenclators Cipher
    Columnar Transposition Cipher
    Enigma Cipher
    Four-Square Cipher
    Fractionated Morse Cipher
    Hill Cipher
    Homophonic Substitution Cipher
    Lorenz Cipher
    Playfair Cipher
    Polybius Square Cipher
    Porta Cipher
    ROT13 Cipher
    Rail-fence Cipher
    Running Key Cipher
    Simple Substitution Cipher
    Straddle Checkerboard Cipher
    Trifid Cipher
    Vigen√®re and Gronsfeld Cipher

    Future Versions Planned (Rough Draft, subject to change.):

    Version 0.1.0 - Terminal program in beta with only Caesar ciphers
    Version 0.2.0 - Add ADFGVX Cipher
    Version 0.3.0 - Add ADFGX Cipher
    Version 0.4.0 - Add Atbash cipher

    Version 1 - Release, Terminal program with 29 types of weak text encryption and decryption.

    Version 2 - GUI added

    Version 3 - Modern encryption added.

    Version 4 - File Encryption.

    Version 5 - Cipher breaker.

    Current TODO list:

    ADFGVX:

    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    ADFGX:

    Fix formatting
    Add more documentation
    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    Rename.
    Logo.
    How to install and run in README.
