# CeasarsCiph
The development goal of this program is to add the capability to use 29 types of weak ciphers through terminal to encrypt and decrypt text. At this point the program has one type, Ceasar Cipher, and it is working. Later versions will add file encryption, code breaker, and modern encryption.

Below is a quick overview of what has been done and what still needs to be done.

The following ciphers have been added:

    Ceasar Cipher

The following ciphers have yet to be added but in progress:

    ADFGVX Cipher
    ADFGX Cipher
    Affine Cipher
    Atbash Cipher
    Autokey Cipher
    Baconian Cipher
    Base64 Cipher
    Beaufort Cipher
    Bifid Cipher
    Codes and Nomenclators Cipher
    Columnar Transposition Cipher
    Enigma Cipher
    Four-Square Cipher
    Fractionated Morse Cipher
    Hill Cipher
    Homophonic Substitution Cipher
    Lorenz Cipher
    Playfair Cipher
    Polybius Square Cipher
    Porta Cipher
    ROT13 Cipher
    Rail-fence Cipher
    Running Key Cipher
    Simple Substitution Cipher
    Straddle Checkerboard Cipher
    Trifid Cipher
    Vigen√®re and Gronsfeld Cipher

    Future Versions Planned (Rough Draft, subject to change.):

    Version 0.0.1 - Terminal program in beta with only Ceasar ciphers
    Version 0.1.0 - Add ADFGVX Cipher

    Version 1 - Release, Terminal program with 29 types of weak text encryption and decryption.

    Version 2 - GUI added

    Version 3 - Modern encryption added.

    Version 4 - Cipher breaker.

    Version 5 - File encryption.

    Current TODO list:

    Change output to all caps.
    Fix letter shift wrap for ceasars cipher.
    Add "About" command.
    Rename.
    Logo.
    How to install and run in README.
    Release and begin version 0.0.1 Beta.
