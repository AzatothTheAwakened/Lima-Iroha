# Lima

The development goal of this program is to create a program that can be used in terminal or GUI to encrypt and decrypt text with weak and modern encryption as well as encrypt files with modern encryptions. See below to find out what has been added and what is scheduled to be added in the future.

Current Version: 0.6.0

Below is a quick overview of what has been done and what still needs to be done.

The following ciphers have been added:

    Caesar Cipher
    ADFGVX Cipher
    ADFGX Cipher
    Atbash Cipher
    ROT13 Cipher
    Affine Cipher

The following ciphers have yet to be added but in progress:

    Autokey
    Baconian
    Base64
    Beaufort
    Bifid
    Codes and Nomenclators

    Version 0.8.0 - Add Barconian
    Version 0.9.0 - Add Polybius Square
    Version 0.10.0 - Add Simple Substitution


    Version 1 - Release, Terminal program with 29 types of weak text encryption and decryption.

    Version 2 - GUI added

    Version 3 - Modern encryption added.

    Current TODO list:

    Caesar Cipher:

    Fix punctuation being encrypted.

    ADFGVX:

    Fix formatting
    Add more documentation
    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    ADFGX:

    Fix formatting
    Add more documentation
    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    Affine Cipher:

    Fix bugs to encryption such as '!' and '.' being allowed into encryption when using mod 26.

    Rename.
    Logo.
