# Lima

The development goal of this program is to create a program that can be used in terminal or GUI to encrypt and decrypt text with weak and modern encryption as well as encrypt files with modern encryptions. See below to find out what has been added and what is scheduled to be added in the future.

Current Version: 0.7.1

--------------------------------------
How to run this program on Linux.
--------------------------------------

Download the repository Lima-Iroha. Once downloaded, cd to the java folder within the main folder in the program. I have the Lima-Iroha folder in /Documents/JAtom so cd for my looks like this.

/Documents/JAtom/Lima-Iroha/src/main/java

Next compile the packages with the following.

javac io/limasecurityworks/ciphers/*.java io/limasecurityworks/ui/*.java

Next run the program with the follwing.

java io/limasecurityworks/ui/Iroha

-------------------------------------

Below is a quick overview of what has been done and what still needs to be done.

The following ciphers have been added:

    Caesar Cipher
    ADFGVX Cipher
    ADFGX Cipher
    Atbash Cipher
    ROT13 Cipher
    Affine Cipher
    Autokey Cipher

    Future Versions Planned (Rough Draft, subject to change.):

    Version 0.1.0 - Terminal program in beta with only Caesar ciphers
    Version 0.2.0 - Add ADFGVX
    Version 0.3.0 - Add ADFGX
    Version 0.4.0 - Add Atbash
    Version 0.5.0 - Add ROT13
    Version 0.6.0 - Add Affine
    Version 0.7.0 - Add Rail-fence
    Version 0.8.0 - Add Barconian
    Version 0.9.0 - Add Polybius Square
    Version 0.10.0 - Add Simple Substitution


    Version 1 - Release, Terminal program with 29 types of weak text encryption and decryption.

    Version 2 - GUI added

    Version 3 - Modern encryption added.

    Version 4 - File Encryption.

    Version 5 - Cipher breaker.

    Current TODO list:

    Caesar Cipher:

    Fix punctuation being encrypted.
    Is not ignoring periods on input for encryption.

    ADFGVX:

    Fix formatting
    Add more documentation
    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    ADFGX:

    Fix formatting
    Add more documentation
    Add ability to quickly generate multiple new key squares.

    Affine Cipher:

    Testing for bugs.
    Update help and about commands.

    Rename.
    Logo.
    How to install and run in README.
